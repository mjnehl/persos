**Meet Aura: The AI Assistant That Manages Your Life, So You Can Live It**

**SAN FRANCISCO – September 27, 2025** – Today, Gemini Labs announces the launch of Aura, a groundbreaking AI personal assistant that redefines human-computer interaction. Aura is a proactive, intelligent partner designed to manage the complexities of modern life, from scheduling meetings and managing household tasks to orchestrating travel and tracking personal goals. By seamlessly integrating with a user's digital life, Aura anticipates needs and acts on them, finally freeing users from the constant cognitive load of administrative life management.

"We all juggle an incredible amount of mental overhead every day," said the CEO of Gemini Labs. "Aura is designed to lift that burden. It’s not just another app; it’s a personalized operating system for your life, working in the background to ensure everything runs smoothly. We’re giving people back their most valuable resource: their time and focus."

Unlike traditional reactive assistants, Aura operates on a principle of proactive, holistic support. It understands that a delayed flight impacts a business meeting and that a stressful workday is the right time to suggest ordering dinner. Aura manages this through three core domains:

*   **Professional Life:** Aura triages communications, manages the entire meeting lifecycle from scheduling to transcription and action item tracking, and intelligently defends the user's calendar to create space for deep work.
*   **Personal Life:** It manages appointments, orchestrates complex travel itineraries, and helps users stay committed to their personal growth and wellness goals.
*   **Home & Logistics:** Aura handles domestic tasks like grocery orders, schedules home maintenance, and acts as the central intelligence for smart home devices.

Aura's most innovative feature is its "Actuator" model, which bridges the digital and physical worlds. While Aura can't fix a leaky pipe itself, it can identify the need from a user's message, source and schedule a top-rated plumber, grant them temporary access, and handle payment, requiring minimal user intervention.

Starting today, users can sign up for Aura access. The service is offered via a simple "Pro" subscription model, with a 30-day free trial, ensuring our focus is always on delivering value to the user, not monetizing their data.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How is Aura different from the voice assistant on my phone or smart speaker?**

A: The difference is proactivity and integration. Standard assistants wait for a command. Aura anticipates your needs based on a deep, holistic understanding of your life, gathered from the apps and services you already use. It doesn't just set a reminder; it manages the entire task lifecycle. It’s the difference between having a calculator and having a personal accountant.

**Q: Is my data safe with Aura?**

A: Absolutely. Trust is the bedrock of Aura. All user data is end-to-end encrypted, and our systems are built with privacy as a first principle. The user is always in control, with transparent, auditable logs of Aura's actions and reasoning.

**Q: What services can Aura integrate with?**

A: At launch, Aura integrates with a wide range of popular services across email, calendars, messaging, travel, finance, and smart home ecosystems. Our goal is to connect to the user's entire digital footprint, and we are continuously expanding our integration library based on user needs.

**Q: How does the "Actuator" model work in the real world?**

A: Aura acts as a master delegator. It uses public APIs, partnerships with service providers, and secure access protocols to manage real-world tasks. For example, it can order from delivery services, book appointments through online scheduling systems, and interact with service providers on your behalf, handling the logistics from start to finish.

**Q: What are the biggest limitations at launch?**

A: Our V1 focuses on perfecting the orchestration of digital services. The "Actuator" model for physical world tasks is powerful but will initially be limited to a curated set of partners and service types. Expanding this network and handling more complex, multi-step physical tasks is our primary focus for post-launch development.

**Q: How will you measure the success of Aura?**

A: Our ultimate measure of success is user empowerment. Internally, we will track metrics related to task completion and proactive actions initiated by Aura. But our true north star is qualitative feedback: are we reducing stress, freeing up time, and helping our users feel more in control of their lives? That is the impact we aim to make.

**Q: How much does Aura cost and why is it a subscription?**

A: Aura is offered as a simple, transparent "Pro" subscription for $30/month. We chose a subscription model because our commitment is to the continuous improvement of your assistant. Your subscription fee directly funds the ongoing work required to keep Aura at the cutting edge, including:

*   **Constant Software Updates:** Regular delivery of new features and security enhancements.
*   **AI Model Advancement:** Your assistant's intelligence will be regularly updated, making it smarter and more capable over time.
*   **Integration Maintenance:** We are constantly working to maintain and expand the connections to the third-party services Aura uses to manage your life.

This model ensures that we are always working for you, the user, and never have a reason to monetize your data. All users receive a 30-day free trial to experience the full capabilities of the assistant.

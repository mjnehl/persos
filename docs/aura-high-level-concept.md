# High-Level Concept: Personal AI Operating System (Self-Hosted)

## Core Architecture Philosophy
**Distributed Self-Sovereign Assistant**: A multi-layered, AI-enhanced microservices architecture that runs entirely on your controlled infrastructure, providing the proactive assistance described in the documents while maintaining complete data sovereignty.

## System Architecture Overview

**Three-Tier Self-Hosted Architecture:**

1. **Edge Layer** (Local Devices)
   - React-based dashboard and mobile interfaces
   - Local AI models for immediate responses
   - Encrypted data synchronization with core services

2. **Core Intelligence Layer** (Your Controlled Infrastructure)
   - Python-based microservices using FastAPI
   - PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for all data persistence
   - Local LLM deployment (e.g., Llama, Mistral) for reasoning
   - Vector database for semantic memory and context

3. **Integration Layer** (Your Controlled Infrastructure)
   - API gateway for external service orchestration
   - Secure credential management and OAuth handling
   - The "Actuator" model implementation for real-world task execution

## Key Differentiators from the Documents

**Data Sovereignty**: Unlike the original vision's on-device approach, this creates a private cloud architecture where you control every component, from the AI models to the databases, while maintaining the seamless experience across all your devices.

**Hybrid AI Strategy**: Combines local models for privacy-sensitive operations with your choice of API-based models for complex reasoning, all routing through your infrastructure.

**Extensible Plugin Architecture**: Rather than a closed ecosystem, this enables you to integrate any service while maintaining full audit trails and data control.

## Core Capabilities (Adapted)

The three domains from the documents remain relevant:
- **Professional Life**: Email triage, meeting management, intelligent scheduling
- **Personal Life**: Appointment booking, travel orchestration, goal tracking  
- **Home & Logistics**: Smart home control, grocery management, maintenance scheduling

## Technical Implementation Strategy

**Microservices Architecture:**
- Authentication/Authorization service
- Context/Memory service (PostgreSQL + vector storage)
- Integration orchestration service
- AI reasoning service (local LLM deployment)
- Task execution service ("Actuator" implementation)
- Event/notification service

**Data Flow:**
All data flows through your controlled infrastructure, with encrypted synchronization between your devices and your private cloud, ensuring you maintain complete control while achieving the seamless experience described in the documents.

This concept preserves the innovative "life operating system" vision while meeting your requirement for complete data control and self-hosted infrastructure.

# Product Requirements Document: Aura Zero-Knowledge AI Personal Assistant

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for Aura, a revolutionary zero-knowledge AI personal assistant that gives users absolute sovereignty over their data. Unlike any existing solution, Aura implements true zero-knowledge architecture where even Aura itself cannot access user data without explicit cryptographic permission. Designed to act as a "life operating system," Aura reduces cognitive load while maintaining unprecedented privacy through client-side encryption and user-controlled access.

**Author:** Gemini
**Status:** Draft
**Target Launch Date:** September 27, 2025

## 2. Vision and Opportunity

**Vision:** To create the world's first truly private AI assistant where users maintain complete control over their data through zero-knowledge architecture, while delivering proactive, intelligent assistance that seamlessly integrates into their lives.

**Problem:** 
1. Modern digital assistants require users to sacrifice privacy for convenience, storing personal data on corporate servers
2. Even "privacy-focused" solutions can still access user data internally
3. Support teams traditionally need data access to help users, creating privacy vulnerabilities
4. Administrative overhead continues to consume time and mental energy

**Opportunity:** Aura revolutionizes the digital assistant market by:
1. Implementing zero-knowledge architecture where all data is encrypted client-side
2. Enabling support without data access through cryptographic delegation
3. Providing proactive assistance while maintaining complete privacy
4. Giving users the ability to instantly revoke any access
5. Creating a new standard for privacy in AI assistants

## 3. Personas

*   **Primary Persona: The Busy Professional (Alex)**
    *   **Demographics:** 30-50 years old, works in a demanding field (e.g., tech, consulting, entrepreneurship).
    *   **Needs:** To offload the mental energy of managing a complex calendar, constant email flow, and frequent travel. Needs to protect their focus time.
    *   **Goals:** Be more present at home, spend less time on administrative tasks, and ensure their personal and professional commitments don't fall through the cracks.

*   **Secondary Persona: The Power Organizer (Casey)**
    *   **Demographics:** 35-55 years old, manages a busy household, possibly with children, and may also have a part-time or full-time job.
    *   **Needs:** A central hub to manage family appointments, school events, household logistics (groceries, maintenance), and social calendars.
    *   **Goals:** Reduce the stress of being the "default" family scheduler, prevent scheduling conflicts, and automate repetitive domestic tasks.

## 4. V1 Feature Set

The V1 launch will focus on delivering a core set of high-impact features that demonstrate the power of proactive assistance and the "Actuator" model.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority | Domain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PRO-01** | Intelligent Scheduling | Proactively manages the user's calendar, defending focus time, suggesting optimal meeting times based on priorities, and resolving conflicts. | **Must-Have** | Professional |
| **PRO-02** | Meeting Lifecycle Mgt. | Schedules meetings, sends pre-read materials to attendees, and generates a post-meeting summary with key action items (transcription will be a post-V1 feature). | **Must-Have** | Professional |

## 5. Non-Goals for V1

To ensure a focused and achievable launch, the following features are explicitly out of scope for V1:

*   **Full Meeting Transcription:** This is a complex feature that will be a fast-follow after launch.
*   **Complex, Multi-Step Physical Tasks:** V1 will focus on digital orchestration. Complex physical tasks (e.g., coordinating multiple contractors for a home renovation) are a future goal.
*   **Mobile-Native Application:** The initial launch will be a desktop application. Mobile app with full encryption is a top priority post-launch.
*   **Enterprise/Team Features:** All V1 features are focused on the individual user.
*   **Plugin Marketplace:** This is a key part of the long-term strategy but will not be included in V1.
*   **Homomorphic AI Operations:** While planned for V2, V1 will use secure enclaves for AI processing.
*   **P2P Sync:** V1 will use encrypted cloud storage; P2P sync is planned for V2.

## 6. Success Metrics

Our success will be measured by privacy protection, user empowerment, and engagement.

*   **North Star Metric:** Number of proactive actions taken by Aura per user per week while maintaining zero data breaches.
*   **Privacy Metrics:**
    *   Zero unauthorized data access incidents
    *   Percentage of support tickets resolved without data access (target: >90%)
    *   Average time to revoke access (<1 minute)
    *   Audit log verification success rate (100%)
*   **Key Business Metric:** Number of active subscribers and conversion rate from free trial to paid (targeting privacy-conscious premium segment).
*   **User Engagement Metrics:**
    *   Daily Active Users (DAU)
    *   Task completion rate (percentage of Aura-suggested tasks that are approved by the user)
    *   Number of connected integrations per user
    *   Trust score from user surveys (target: >95%)
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** Regular surveys measuring user trust, privacy confidence, and perceived reduction in cognitive load.

## 7. Privacy-First Design Principles

1. **User Sovereignty:** Users have absolute control over their data
2. **Zero-Knowledge by Default:** Aura cannot access user data without explicit permission
3. **Cryptographic Guarantees:** Privacy enforced through mathematics, not policy
4. **Transparent Access:** All data access is logged and user-visible
5. **Instant Revocation:** Users can revoke any access immediately
6. **Support Without Compromise:** Revolutionary model for helping users without seeing their data

## 8. Competitive Advantages

### Unprecedented Privacy
- **First True Zero-Knowledge Assistant:** No other AI assistant offers complete zero-knowledge architecture
